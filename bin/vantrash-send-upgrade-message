<p>Dear VanTrash User,</p>

<p>20 months ago we launched VanTrash to help Vancouver's citizens remember to take their garbage and recycling out. Since then we've watched our user base grow to over 3000 citizens (that we know of!). Thank you for making Vantrash a huge success and a ton of fun.</p>

<p>We're emailing you because we have 3 quick messages:</p>

<p><strong>1. Today, we're proud to introduce VanTrash's successor: <a href="http://recollect.net">Recollect.net</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Recollect has the same reminders as VanTrash but works in many cities and features Text Message and Phone Call notifications available for a low cost. (Email and iCal remain free).</p>

<p>To migrate your VanTrash reminder to Recollect <a href="$migrate_url">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. More Cities</strong></p>

<p><a href=http://recollect.net/>Recollect</a> is expanding to other cities, making life just a little bit easier for even more citizens. So far we have added North Vancouver and Victoria (including Oak Bay and Esquimalt) with more (Edmonton, Toronto) to come.</p>

<p><strong>3. Let a Friend Know</strong></p>
