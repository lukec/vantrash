If you take no action, we will migrate your twitter reminder over to
recollect.net at the end of February 2011.  However, you will need to follow
the \@recollectnet twitter user, who will send you twitter messages.

Follow \@recollectnet now to avoid any interruption:

About 20 months ago we started to build VanTrash to help citizens of Vancouver
remember to take their garbage and recycling out with less stress.  Since then
we have watched as almost 3000 citizens have made use of this service (that we
know of), and we have sent almost 20,000 garbage day notifications.

Today we are proud to announce that we have rebuilt VanTrash as a new service
called Recollect.net.  In addition to the features VanTrash had, Recollect can 
notify you via your mobile phone or your home phone with text messages or
voice calls.

Recollect will also allow us to expand to other cities, making life just a
little bit easier for even more citizens.

If you would prefer to receive a text message or phone call notification, or
if you would like to change the details of your current reminder, then click
this link migrate to Recollect:

  Click here: $migrate_url

$do_nothing_message

We hope that Recollect continues to be a useful service to you.  Please tell
your friends and family about Recollect.net!

If you have any feedback for us please send it to feedback\@recollect.net.

Thanks,
The VanTrash / Recollect Team - Kevin, David and Luke.
